# Seagull-Assistant-Bot
A Pokemon Go discord bot helper. The main purpose is to help tournament staff host tournaments with as many resources at their fingertips as possible while also being a resource for those in the tournament. The bot also has other things like it keeps track of local nests for a community, handles reminders for different items, and more.

This bot is currently hosted via a local server. There is currently a plan in place to migrate the bot to github / heroku much like the test bot currently is hosted. This would include a migration of the local SQL DB as well.
